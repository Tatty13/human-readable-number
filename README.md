# Human Readable Number

## Task
The task is to implement function `toReadable` that converts given number, to readable string.

For example:
```js
toReadable(1); // Will return 'one'
toReadable(997); //will return 'nine hundred ninety seven'
```

You can find even more examples in `test.js`

*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*

## Prepare and test
